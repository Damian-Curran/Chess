# Chess

The functionality of this App is to play like a chess game with as many of the rules but not all.
The app contains many rules to not allow you to take your own pieces, for pawns to only attack diagnolly and move forward,
each piece has its own set of rules they must abide by.

Each player has one move before it switches to the opposing player, starting with White.

The purpose of Chess is to try and checkmate your opponent where he cannot move his King without it being in the path of one of your pieces or if the openent decides to forfeit.
